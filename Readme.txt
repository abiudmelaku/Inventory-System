This Inventory system is an upgrade of version 1. The program function is exactly the same. It's just writen in a better data structure.
I've used a nested hashmap to map my category and items together. I've also implemented MVC for clarity sake.
One additional feature i've added is if your using the comandline to run python
you can specify the path where you want to put your csv database. This is done as "python Inventory\launcher.py csvfilename". 

For Example ( python Inventory\launcher.py C:\Users\Abi\Documents\csvDB\db.csv) 

Thank you for taking time to look at my code.Please tell me if it  needs improvments or has erros.
